# Audi-vs-Mercedes
Visual representation of the performance of Audi and Mercedes used cars.
Based on this a buyer can make a better decision in choosing the Brand and Model.
We will be visualizing various Uni-variate and Multivariate plots to understand the relationship between the variables. 
Also, we will draw some Time series-based charts to witness how peopleâ€™s preference for what they want in their cars have changed over time.
My project comprises three parts. It revolves around providing a comparative study: -
1.	Among different models of Audi cars in terms of price, miles per gallon, Road Tax, etc.
2.	Among different models of Mercedes cars in terms of price, miles per gallon, Road Tax, etc.
3.	Lastly overall comparison between Audi and Mercedes cars in terms of miles per gallon for different price ranges i.e.which Brand gives better performance in a given price range.
